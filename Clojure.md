## Clojure Examples
Let's adapt the concepts from SICP to Clojure, a modern Lisp dialect known for its functional programming features. Clojure, being a functional language, is inherently well-suited for illustrating SICP concepts.

### 1. Abstraction

Abstraction in Clojure is often achieved through functions and higher-order functions, enabling the creation of general-purpose, reusable code components.

```clojure
(defn circle-area [radius]
  (* Math/PI radius radius))

(defn circle-perimeter [radius]
  (* 2 Math/PI radius))

;; Usage
(circle-area 5)
(circle-perimeter 5)
```

### 2. Recursive Thinking

Clojure, like other Lisps, naturally supports recursion. A typical example is calculating the factorial of a number.

```clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (if (zero? n)
    1
    (* n (factorial (dec n)))))

;; Usage
(factorial 5) ; Output: 120
```

### 3. Procedural and Data Abstraction

Clojure separates data and procedures, treating functions as first-class citizens and often using immutable data structures.

```clojure
(defrecord BankAccount [balance])

(defn deposit [account amount]
  (assoc account :balance (+ (:balance account) amount)))

(defn withdraw [account amount]
  (assoc account :balance (- (:balance account) amount)))

;; Usage
(def account (->BankAccount 1000))
(def updated-account (deposit account 500))
```

### 4. Functional Programming

Functional programming is a core philosophy in Clojure, emphasizing immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions.

```clojure
(defn square [x] (* x x))

;; Usage
(square 5) ; Output: 25
```

### 5. Metalinguistic Abstraction

Clojure's macros allow for metalinguistic abstraction, enabling the creation of new language constructs and DSLs.

```clojure
(defmacro unless [condition body]
  `(if (not ~condition) ~body))

;; Usage
(unless false (println "This will print"))
```

### 6. Modularity, Objects, and State

Clojure promotes modularity through namespaces and functional decomposition. State is managed through immutable data structures and stateful constructs like atoms when necessary.

```clojure
(ns counter-module)

(def counter (atom 0))

(defn increment-counter []
  (swap! counter inc))

(defn get-counter []
  @counter)

;; Usage
(increment-counter)
(get-counter) ; Output: 1
```

### 7. Concurrency and Lazy Evaluation

Clojure provides excellent support for concurrency and parallelism, notably through its immutable data structures and constructs like atoms, agents, and refs. Lazy evaluation is a default feature in many of Clojure's constructs, like sequences.

```clojure
;; Lazy Evaluation
(def lazy-seq (map inc (range)))

;; Usage
(take 5 lazy-seq) ; Output: (1 2 3 4 5)
```

### 8. Symbolic Computing

Clojure, being a Lisp, is naturally suited for symbolic computing. Its data structures can easily represent symbols and expressions, and its macros allow for manipulation of these at a language level.

```clojure
(defn symbolic-constant [value]
  {:type :constant :value value})

(defn simplify [expr]
  (case (:type expr)
    :constant (:value expr)))

;; Usage
(simplify (symbolic-constant 5)) ; Output: 5
```

Each of these examples illustrates a concept from SICP adapted to Clojure. The functional nature of Clojure, along with its Lisp heritage, makes it particularly well-suited for demonstrating these concepts in a concise and expressive manner.
