# Simple SICP Concepts in Multiple Languages
# README for SICP Examples Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of simplified programming examples inspired by the concepts presented in "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP) by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman. The examples demonstrate key SICP concepts, adapted to various programming languages. Each language is represented in its own Markdown file, providing clear and concise code samples.

### Repository Structure

- `README.md` (this file): Provides an overview of the repository.
- `OVERVIEW.md`: A detailed overview of the SICP concepts and how they are implemented across different languages.
- Individual Markdown files for each programming language:
  - `Java.md`
  - `TypeScript.md`
  - `Kotlin.md`
  - ... (additional languages as added)

### Contents in Each Language File

Each Markdown file dedicated to a programming language includes:

- A brief introduction to the language and its relevance to SICP concepts.
- Simplified code examples for each of the following SICP concepts:
  1. Abstraction
  2. Recursive Thinking
  3. Procedural and Data Abstraction
  4. Functional Programming
  5. Metalinguistic Abstraction
  6. Modularity, Objects, and State
  7. Concurrency and Lazy Evaluation
  8. Symbolic Computing

### Note on Simplification

The examples in this repository are intentionally simplified to serve as an introduction to the profound concepts from SICP. They aim to provide a basic understanding and are not exhaustive implementations. The simplification helps in grasping the core ideas without being overwhelmed by the complexity that a complete implementation might entail.
